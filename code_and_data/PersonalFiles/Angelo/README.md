In the EDA Folder, you can find all the plots which contain insightfull info about the data.

these can all be ran by typing into the terminal (after enabling the function in the file, it's all bound together by duct-tape after all.):
`python EDA.py`

### Invested time in the project

n'th of June | what?
--- | ---   
3-10 | Data exploration for cleaning.etc
11 | tried to improve upon the data set format
12 | temporarily gave up improving the data set, started trying to interpolate wind direction linearly
13 | got the idea to interpolate wind direction according to its independent vectors, finished interpolation methods for Cubic rom-spline and linear interpolation
14 | bugfixing
15 | bugfixing
16 | more bugfixing
17 | Fixed "bugs" in interpolation methods, created a program that makes plots of all the combinations of sensors with their readings during wind speeds. also plotted all chems to the wind speed.
18 | Worked on scatterplots for chemical abundancy, tried to use bokeh with markdown pages
19 | Made cumulative abundancy plots for the chemicals at each sensor
20 | Updated the final data
21 | Worked on the report and plots
22 | Worked on the report
23 | -- (weekend be weekend)
24 | made different correction functions for sensor 4
25 | explored github pages and possibilities therein
26 | worked on the report, exploring different visualisations for data
27 | tried working on the website, errors everywhere
28 | worked like mad on the still incomplete report.
