# Pre-processing by Angelo Groot
For each of the 4 categories of pre-processing is a seperate .py file:
- cleaning.py
- integration.py
- transformation.py
- reduction.py

these can all be ran by typing into the terminal:
`python main.py`


## notes
- manual linear regression on points where 300+ -> 100-?
- Cubic spline seems to be unable to fill the last 2 entries.
- The period from 2016-4-30:22:00 to 2016-08-04-17:00 has been neglected in the interpolation because of unavailable data.
- apparantly, there are hours missing in the readings
