# TO-DO

## Main Questions:

- [ ] Do all the sensors appear to be accurate at all times? (reliability)
- [ ] Are the factories actively expelling their chemicals at all times?
- [ ] Do the factories vary in what composition of chemicals they expel over time?

### Week 1: Data Cleaning

- [x] Git + readme created
- [x] Data cleaning (removing empty rows, columns, elevation.etc)
- [x] Linear regression of wind directions using degrees
- [x] Philip regression of wind direction over time
- [x] Creating a minimalistic map of environment
- [x] 4 days missing in geometrical data
- [x] Sometimes a few hours of data are missing in the readings

### Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

##### Angelo

> - [x] Grouping data by month: how to?
> - [x] Creating standard xlsx or csv file for common data source
> - [x] Automatically dividing degrees into cos and sin in interpolate functions
> - [ ] handle missing data in readings
> - [x] set up the backbone the the report  
> - [ ] check correlation between Wind Speed and Direction?
> - [ ] check correlation between Wind Speed and time/day?

##### Hidde

> - [ ] Plotting the area
> - [ ] Checking how to determine whether sensors align with a factory at a given moment (with wind direction)

##### Sven

> - [ ] Check workings of sensors, comparing them to their neighbours.

##### Philip

> - [ ] Finding out how fast gasses diffuse in athmospheric composition (at 370m Elevation)?
> - [ ] Creating a gaussian model for gasseous distribution (spread) according to wind speed?

- [ ] covariance of neighbours vs opposites


### Week 3: In Depth Analysis

- [ ] create a to-do list for week 3

### Week 4: Product Demo & Final Submit

- [ ] create a to-do list for week 4
