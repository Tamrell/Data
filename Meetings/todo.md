# TO-DO

## Main Questions:

- [ ] Do all the sensors appear to be accurate at all times? (reliability)
- [ ] Are the factories actively expelling their chemicals at all times?
- [ ] Do the factories vary in what composition of chemicals they expel over time?

### Part 1: Data Cleaning

- [x] Git + readme created
- [ ] Data cleaning (removing empty rows, columns, elevation.etc)
- [ ] Linear regression of wind directions using degrees
- [ ] Philip regression of wind direction over time
- [ ] Creating a minimalistic map of environment
- [x] 4 days missing in geometrical data

### Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

##### Angelo

> - [x] Grouping data by month: how to?
> - [ ] Creating standard xlsx or csv file for common data source
> - [ ] Automatically dividing degrees into cos and sin for interpolation
> - [ ] check correlation between Wind Speed and Direction
> - [ ] check correlation between Wind Speed and time/day
