# Schedule
Here will be kept a weekly schedule for the project in order to keep track of:
- goals
- task management

## Current challenges

-----

- Wind speed (m/s) is measured every 3 hours, while the chemicals are measured every hour. We will have to use regression in order to fill in the Wind speeds at every hour.
- The elevation (m) only has 1 value, apparantly this is the same at all points so it is irrelevent for comparison.
- Column 'Date Time' is actually 'Date Time '
- Redundant Data, we can add columns for each chemical in the following form:
 
Date Time | Chemical 1 , Sensor 1 | Chem 1, S2... | Chem 2, S1 .etc
--- | --- | --- | ---
8:09 | 204.5 | 100.3 | 240.2
?? | ?? | ?? | ??
